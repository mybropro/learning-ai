## Learning about AI
This is a repo for me to learn about/document/practice AI. I need to learn what's actually happening with AI research + product development. If your priors are similar to [mine](PRIORS.md), maybe you can learn something by following along.

## Goals
+ Understand the [historical timeline](TIMELINE.md)
+ What is the current state-of-the-art?
+ Differentiate between hype and reality in AI propaganda. Who can actually provide value with "AI" and who is just good at data processing + analysis?
+ Some example project that builds pracitcal skills.
+ Answer outstanding [questions](QUESTIONS.md)
+ [Learn something](LESSONS.md)

## Status
Early stage research - as of 1/27/22
