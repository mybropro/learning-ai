Takeaways from this project (to be continued).

1. Do not project how *you* think *you* think onto how AI systems *should* think. You probably can't enscapulate your brain into a model, and even if you could it's probably not accurate.
2. Needing a generalized solution means you can't feature engineer. See [smart self-driving cars](https://comma.ai) vs line following robots.
3. Don't fall for [tricks](MARKETING_TRICKS.md)
